  <h3 class = "size1 lining">Jay G. (CO-Founder, CO-CEO, CFO)</h3> <p class="size1 lining"> My brother and I always had a passion for becoming business men. We aspired to be owners of a company. We loved watching business shows such as "The Profit" and "Shark Tank". We wanted to help the world become a better place. If we owned a company that would make a big change in our and other people's lives. Then, our dad got a new home in Saratoga. When we moved in, we met some neighberhood friends, and we started to hang out and play with them. We decided to create a business. Over time, we have created a friendship bond, and we are all very happy to work with each other. Our friends helped create products, helped create the website, and helped our company expand. We will still expand our company with products and with employees. We all hope that one day our company can go big! We all hope that one day our company can change the world!</p> <h3 class = "size1 lining">Matteo G.(CO-Founder, CO-CEO, CPO)</h3> <p class="size1 lining"> Let's start with the beginning of my career when I was seven years old. I don't mean by working at an official business and getting a paycheck. I mean, selling little 4-page comic books with my twin brother. We would wake up in the morning and were ready to draw and write comic books. We would work until lunch, take a quick break and then went right back to work. Then after transferring to a new home with our dad, we met some neighbors. I couldn't have gotten some ideas without the amazing positivity and finite support illustrated by my friends. We started achieving progress with our business and we know we can keep expanding this company, not just with employees, but with our faith and confidence in this company by offering new and fun products and services to the World!</p> <h3 class = "size1 lining">Max M. (CMO)</h3> <p class="size1 lining">I recently moved to California from Michigan and moved to a new school. At my new school, I met a few friends, Jay, Matteo and Noah. Jay and Matteo had a business and the following week after entering the school, they asked me if I knew how to code just like they knew how to. I said not much but I know how to advertise. They then asked me if I wanted to join their business. I told them that I would be glad to take this opportunity. I am now the chief marketing officer, and hope I can help this business grow, to turn this business into a world wide company. I know that this business can achieve its goals if we all work together as a team and have confidence. I believe we have the ability to make the world become a better place! Max Out!
 </p> <h3 class = "size1 lining">Noah D. (CTO)</h3> <p class="size1 lining"> In seventh grade, three new kids entered my grade. Jay and Max were in my class, and Jayâ€™s twin, Matteo, was in the other class. I have always been fascinated in business and always wanted to be part of one. But I never had the idea to start one of my own. It turned out that Jay and Matteo owned one and were looking for employees to hire. One day, Jay came up to me and asked if I wanted to accompany them on their business journey. I told them that I would love to and that is when our company really took flight. I always had faith in this business and will continue to and I aspire to help this business expand. I know the greatness our company can achieve and I know that we can make a difference in the world!
